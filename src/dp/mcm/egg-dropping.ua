# You are given N floor and K eggs. You have to minimize 
# the number of times you have to drop the eggs to find 
# the critical floor where critical floor means the floor 
# beyond which eggs start to break. Assumptions of the 
# problem:

# If egg breaks at ith floor then it also breaks at all greater floors.
# If egg does not break at ith floor then it does not break at all lower floors.
# Unbroken egg can be used again.
# Note: You have to find minimum trials required to find the critical floor not the critical floor.
